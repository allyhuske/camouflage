# camouflage
Artificial life program for WisdomGroup internship. Multicolored dots evolve to match a background color.

Use user input camo if you want to set variables before evolution begins from the display, see evolution occurring, change the background color as the program runs, and pause and play the program.

Use fast camo if you want to run the program quickly and look over data at the end.

The average fitness of the population over time is recorded by user input camo in a file called userpopfit.txt. The average fitness of the population each time the predator function is called is recorded by fast camo in a file called fastpopfit.txt. Running the program appends new data to the end of the text file if it already exists, so make sure to delete the file if you don't want the old data piling up.
